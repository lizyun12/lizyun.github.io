			Featured: Un Jardin Sur le Nil. Inspired by a walk through the garden islands along the Nile River, this opens with bright grapefruit and mango, followed by watery lotus, splashes of carrot and tomato, and dries down to moderate incense. Refreshing enough for a humid day, but complex enough to enjoy distinctive notes. A must-have for summer.
